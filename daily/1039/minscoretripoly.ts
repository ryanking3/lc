//here is the code explained in depth:
// The function `minScoreTriangulation` takes an array of integers `values` as input, where each integer represents the value of a vertex in a polygon. The goal is to find the minimum score of triangulating the polygon formed by these vertices. The score of a triangulation is defined as the sum of the products of the values of the vertices that form each triangle in the triangulation.

// The function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the minimum score for triangulating the polygon formed by the vertices from index `i` to index `j`. The size of the `dp` array is `n x n`, where `n` is the number of vertices in the input array.

// The outer loop iterates over possible lengths of sub-polygons, starting from length 2 (which corresponds to a triangle) up to length `n-1` (the entire polygon). For each length, it iterates over all possible starting indices `i` for the sub-polygons. The ending index `j` is calculated as `i + length`.

// For each sub-polygon defined by indices `i` and `j`, the function initializes `dp[i][j]` to infinity, indicating that it has not yet found a valid triangulation for this sub-polygon 
// The innermost loop iterates over all possible vertices `k` that can be used to form a triangle with the vertices at indices `i` and `j`. For each vertex `k`, it calculates the cost of forming a triangle with vertices `i`, `k`, and `j`, which is given by the product of their values: `values[i] * values[k] * values[j]`. It then adds this cost to the minimum scores of triangulating the two resulting sub-polygons: `dp[i][k]` and `dp[k][j]`. 
// The function updates `dp[i][j]` with the minimum score found so far for triangulating the sub-polygon from `i` to `j`.

// After filling in the `dp` array, the function returns `dp[0][n - 1]`, which contains the minimum score for triangulating the entire polygon formed by all vertices in the input array.
